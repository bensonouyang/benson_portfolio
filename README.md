# [Kiln Identification](https://github.com/bensonouyang/Kiln_Identification)
* Utilized Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify whether a kiln is detected in satellite images
* Performed feature engineering by changing the colourspace, size and augmentation of the image data with Albumentations
* Finished in the top 10 of the in class kaggle competition with a final AUC of 0.68

# [NFT Sale Price Prediction](https://github.com/bensonouyang/NFT-Sale-Price-Prediction)
* Applied machine learning and deep learning models to predict NFT sale price using image and text data
* Executed text and image processing to generate improved features
* Implemented cross validation to compare between several different models and performed a grid search to fine tune hyperparameters
* Finished in the top 10 of the in class kaggle competition with a final MAE of 6.97

# [Fantasy Basketball Players List](https://github.com/bensonouyang/Fantasy-Basketball)
* Created a python program to discover the top performing NBA players of each position given the weights of each stat from a fantasy league
* Scraped NBA players stats data from a website using BeautifulSoup and gathered the data into a dataframe with Pandas
* Implemented the ability for users to search for the top performing players of each position based on their average fantasy points
